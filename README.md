## üéØ Our Mission

Drishyam (from Sanskrit '*‡§¶‡•É‡§∂‡•ç‡§Ø‡§Æ‡•ç*', meaning 'vision') was born during a hackathon with a clear and urgent mission: to make the visual world more accessible. This tool is dedicated to assisting individuals with visual impairments and cognitive disabilities, providing them with the independence to understand and interact with visual information effortlessly. We believe technology should bridge gaps, and Drishyam is our contribution to a more inclusive digital and physical environment.

## üí° About The Project

Drishyam is an AI-powered image narrator that transforms static images into rich, audible descriptions. For someone who is visually impaired, it's a pair of eyes. For someone with a cognitive disability, it's a patient and clear guide to understanding complex visual scenes.

Unlike simple alt-text which often misses context, Drishyam analyzes the entire image‚Äîthe objects, their interactions, the environment, and even the potential atmosphere‚Äîto create a narrative that is both descriptive and easy to comprehend.

## ‚öô Core Functionalities for Accessibility

Every feature in Drishyam is designed with our users' needs at the forefront:

* *Detailed Scene Understanding:* Goes beyond naming objects to explain relationships, locations, and context. It can differentiate between a person walking in a park versus a person running in a race, providing crucial context.
* *Clear & Simple Narration:* The AI generates descriptions that are structured, coherent, and easy to follow, helping to reduce cognitive load.
* *Adjustable Narration Detail:* Users can choose the level of detail they need:
    * *Quick Scan:* A brief, one-sentence summary for rapid identification (e.g., "A photo of a blue cereal box on a table.").
    * *Full Description:* A detailed, multi-sentence narrative for a complete understanding of the scene.
* *Natural & Calm Voice Synthesis:* Utilizes a state-of-the-art Text-to-Speech (TTS) engine that is clear and pleasant to listen to, preventing listening fatigue.
* *Multi-Language Support:* Accessibility is global. Drishyam provides narration in English and Hindi (*‡§π‡§ø‡§®‡•ç‡§¶‡•Ä*) to serve a diverse community.

## üöÄ How It Works

The technology is complex, but the user experience is simple:

1.  *Capture or Upload:* The user points their camera at an object or uploads an existing image.
2.  *AI Analysis:* In seconds, our vision model analyzes the scene to understand its content.
3.  *Narrative Generation:* The AI crafts a clear text description based on the user's preferred detail level.
4.  *Audio Playback:* The description is read aloud through the device's speaker or headphones.
